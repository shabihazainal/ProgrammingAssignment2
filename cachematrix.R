## R Programming Assignment 2: Lexical Scoping--caching the inverse of a matrix


# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = numeric()) {
  
  # holds the cached value or NULL if nothing is cached
  # initially nothing is cached so set it to NULL
  cache <- NULL
  
  # store a matrix
  setMatrix <- function(newValue) {
    x <<- newValue
    # since the matrix is assigned a new value, flush the cache
    cache <<- NULL
  }
  
  # returns the stored matrix
  getMatrix <- function() {
    x
  }
  
  # cache the given argument 
  cacheInverse <- function(solve) {
    cache <<- solve
  }
  
  # get the cached value
  getInverse <- function() {
    cache
  }
  
  # return a list. Each named element of the list is a function
  list(setMatrix = setMatrix, getMatrix = getMatrix, cacheInverse = cacheInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}



## The cacheSolve function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
## the special "matrix" which created with the makeCacheMatrix function.
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated.
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation.
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse
## in the cache via the setinverse function.

# The following function calculates the inverse of a "special" matrix created with 
# makeCacheMatrix
cacheSolve <- function(y, ...) {
  # get the cached value
  inverse <- y$getInverse()
  # if a cached value exists return it
  if(!is.null(inverse)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inverse)
  }
  # otherwise get the matrix, caclulate the inverse and store it in
  # the cache
  data <- y$getMatrix()
  inverse <- solve(data)
  y$cacheInverse(inverse)
  
  # return the inverse
  inverse
}
